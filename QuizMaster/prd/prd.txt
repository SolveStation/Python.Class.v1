Terminal QuizMaster 
Project Name: Terminal QuizMaster Type: Console Application (CLI) Tech Stack: Python Data 
Store: Local CSV files 
1. Objectives 
Functional 
Create a working application where admins can add questions to a database (CSV) and 
students can take quizzes and save results. 
Pedagogical 
● Polymorphism: Handle different question types (Multiple Choice vs. True/False) 
uniformly. 
● Encapsulation: Protect user passwords and score data. 
● Inheritance: Create user roles and question hierarchies. 
● File I/O: Manually reading/writing objects to text format (Serialization/Deserialization). 
2. Core Features (User Stories) 
Authentication System 
● Register: Users can sign up as an Admin or Student. Data is saved to users.csv. 
● Login: System reads users.csv to validate credentials and instantiate the correct User 
object. 
Admin Role 
● Add Question: Admin can create a new question. They must specify the type (e.g., 
"MCQ" or "Boolean"). 
● View Results: Admin can view a leaderboard of all student scores (reads results.csv). 
Student Role 
● Take Quiz: The system loads questions from questions.csv, iterates through them, and 
captures input. 
● View History: Student can see their own past performance. 
3. OOP Architecture 
A. The User Hierarchy (Inheritance) 
● User (Abstract Base Class) 
○ Attributes: username, __password (private) 
○ Methods: login(), logout() 
● Admin (Child of User) 
○ Methods: add_question(), view_all_results() 
● Student (Child of User) 
○ Methods: take_quiz(), view_my_results() 
B. The Question Hierarchy (Polymorphism) 
● Question (Abstract Base Class) 
○ Attributes: text, difficulty, category 
○ Abstract Methods: display(), check_answer(input) 
● MCQQuestion (Child of Question) 
○ Attributes: options (List), correct_option_index 
○ Polymorphism: display() shows the question + labeled options (A, B, C, D). 
● TrueFalseQuestion (Child of Question) 
○ Attributes: correct_bool 
○ Polymorphism: display() shows the question + "[T/F]". 
C. Data Management (Static Methods & File I/O) 
● FileManager Class 
○ A utility class with static methods to handle the raw CSV operations. This separates 
logic from data access. 
○ Methods: read_csv(filename), append_to_csv(filename, data) 
4. Data Model (CSV Schema) 
1. users.csv 
id,username,password,role 
1,mr_teacher,securepass,admin 
2,john_doe,student123,student 
 
2. questions.csv 
Note: The options column can be a pipe-separated string (e.g., "Red|Blue|Green") to teach 
string splitting. 
id,type,text,options,answer,difficulty 
101,mcq,What is the capital of France?,Paris|London|Berlin,Paris,1 
102,tf,Python is compiled.,,False,1 
 
3. results.csv 
student_id,score,total_questions,date 
2,8,10,2023-10-27 
5. Implementation Logic Flow 
1. Startup: App initializes FileManager. Checks if CSVs exist; if not, creates them with 
headers. 
2. Auth Loop: User enters credentials. 
○ Code Challenge: Read users.csv. If match found, create an instance of Admin or 
Student based on the "role" column. 
3. Menu Loop: Based on the instance type (isinstance(current_user, Admin)), show different 
menus. 
4. Quiz Loop (Polymorphism): 
○ Load rows from questions.csv. 
○ Convert rows into a list of objects: [MCQQuestion(...), TrueFalseQuestion(...)]. 
○ Loop through list calling q.display() and q.check_answer(). 
5. Save: Append score to results.csv.
