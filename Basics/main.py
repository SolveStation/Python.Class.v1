# VARIABLE NAMING
"""
    Start with a letter or underscore: A variable name must begin with a letter (a-z, A-Z) or an underscore (_). 
    It cannot start with a number.
    Allowed characters: 
    Variable names can only contain alpha-numeric characters and underscores (A-z, 0-9, and _).
    Special characters such as spaces, hyphens (-), @, #, or $ are not allowed.
    No Python keywords: You cannot use any of Python's 35 reserved keywords
    (like if, else, for, while, class, print) 
    as variable names, as they have special purposes in the language.
    Case-sensitive: Variable names are case-sensitive, which means age, Age, and AGE are considered three different variables   
"""

Age = 10
AGe = 20
AGE = 50

print(f"As you can see there are not the same: {age} {Age} {AGe} {AGE}")
